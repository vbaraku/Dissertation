# Secure Decentralized Marketplace for Microstocks
This is my dissertation project for my BSc in Computer Science. This dissertation aims to present and implement a web-based, secure, decentralized
marketplace for microstocks. The rationale behind developing and implementing
a decentralized marketplace where intangible ‘creations of mind’ are traded is that
through blockchain technology the need for intermediaries is eliminated, hence resulting in a transparent, cheaper, and unbiased market, albeit a secure one that
guarantees integrity of transactions and confidentiality of traded artefacts. The
report will present an overview of blockchain technology fundamentals, demonstrate smart contract implementations, and employ multiple encryption schemes
to provide security.
