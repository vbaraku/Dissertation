# Secure Decentralized Marketplace for Microstocks
Final year project for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The project's objective was to
develop a web-based secure, decentralized marketplace for microstocks, with the rationale being that
blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, resulting in a transparent, cheaper, and
unbiased market, albeit a secure one that guaranteed transaction integrity and trade artefact
confidentiality. The technologies utilized in the project include:
• Smart contracts,
• Solidity,
• Hardhat,
• IPFS (InterPlanetary File System),
• React
A variety of encryption schemes, including ECIES, AES, and SHA-256, were employed to develop a
protocol that ensures the security and confidentiality of transacting parties.
